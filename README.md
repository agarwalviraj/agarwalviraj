Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Viraj Agarwal
</h1>

I am a Computer Science Engineering undergrature with interest in building amazing websites. I like to code in typescript and have worked with typescript in React and Vue.

Other than that I have a basic to intermediate knowledge of Node.js and plan on learning Springboot as I am familiar with Java. Low level programming really peaks my interest which is why I want to add languages like Rust, Haskell and Go to my skill-set.
